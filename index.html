  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective date: February 28, 2026</p>

  <p>Norwegian Singles ("the App") is a running workout generator built by an independent developer. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>None.</strong> Norwegian Singles does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. The App runs entirely on your device.</p>

  <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>The following data is stored locally on your iPhone and never leaves your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Race results and VDOT score</strong> &mdash; used to calculate your training paces</li>
    <li><strong>Unit and surface preferences</strong> &mdash; used to personalize workouts</li>
    <li><strong>Saved workouts</strong> &mdash; your workout library</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can delete all stored data at any time by uninstalling the App.</p>

  <h2>Apple HealthKit</h2>
  <p>The App may request access to Apple HealthKit to save completed workouts to your health data and to send structured workouts to Apple Watch via WorkoutKit. HealthKit data is handled entirely by Apple's frameworks and is never accessed by us. The App does not read HealthKit data from other apps.</p>
  <p>Granting HealthKit access is optional and the App functions fully without it.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or crash-reporting services. There are no SDKs that collect or transmit data.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The App contains no account system, no social features, and no data collection of any kind.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we update this privacy policy, the revised version will be posted at this URL with an updated effective date.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can reach us at <a href="mailto:norwegiansinglesapp@gmail.com">norwegiansinglesapp@gmail.com</a>.</p>
